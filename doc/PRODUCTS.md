#### Available methods:
**GET**
You can send request either with product ID as a parameter and get product detail or without any parameter and receive all your products list:
```
...
$products = new Products($mpapiClient);
// Get all product ids
$response = $products->get();

/**
 * If you want to receive more products data in one request, you can use a filter.
 * By now two types of filters are available: 'ids' and 'basic'.
 * ids - returns only list of product IDs
 * basic - returns list of basic product data (id, product_id, title, status, category_id, variants_count, has_variants)
 */
$products->setFilter(Products::FILTER_TYPE_BASIC);
$response = $products->get();

// Get product detail
$response = $products->get('123abc');
```

**DELETE**
You can delete just one product at a time or more products together:
```
...
// delete one product
$products = new Products($mpapiClient);
$response = $products->delete('123abc');

...
// delete more products
$productsSynchronizer = new Products($mpapiClient);
$productSynchronizer->add(new Product(['id' => '123abc']))
					->add(new Product(['id' => '456def']))
					->delete();
```

**POST**
Use post method to create new products.
```
...
// create one product
$product = new Product();
$product->setId('pTU00_test')
		->setTitle('Testing product title')
		->setShortdesc('Some short description')
		->setPackageSize(PackageSize::SMALLBOX)
		...

$productsService = new Products($mpapiClient);
$response = $productsService->post($product);
```

```
// create more products
$product1 = new Product();
$product1->setId('pTU00_test')
		 ->setTitle('Testing product title')
		 ->setShortdesc('Some short description')
		 ->setPackageSize(PackageSize::SMALLBOX)
		...

$product2 = new Product();
$product2->setId('pTU00_test2')
		->setTitle('Testing product title 2')
		->setShortdesc('Short description')
		->setPackageSize(PackageSize::BIGBOX)
		...

$productSynchronizer->add($product1)
					->add($product2)
					...
					->post();
```
For a large number of products you can use asynchronous request processing (also for PUT method).
```
// create more products
$product1 = new Product();
$product1->setId('pTU00_test')
		 ->setTitle('Testing product title')
		 ->setShortdesc('Some short description')
		 ->setPackageSize(PackageSize::BIGBOX)
		...

$product2 = new Product();
$product2->setId('pTU00_test2')
		->setTitle('Testing product title 2')
		->setShortdesc('Short description')
		->setPackageSize(PackageSize::SMALLBOX)
		...

$requestHash = $productSynchronizer->add($product1)
					->add($product2)
					...
					->asynchronous()
					->post();

// check status of request processing
foreach ($requestHash as $hash) {
 var_dump($variants->getAsynchronouseStatus($hash));
}

```

**PUT**
To update products, send put request for one or more products:
```
...
// to update one product
$product = new Product();
$product->setId('pTU00_test')
		->setTitle('Testing product title')
		->setShortdesc('Some short description')
		->setPackageSize(PackageSize::SMALLBOX)
		...

$productsService = new Products($mpapiClient);
$response = $productsService->put('pTU00_test', $product);
```

```
// update more products
$product1 = new Product();
$product1->setId('pTU00_test')
	->setTitle('Testing product title')
	->setShortdesc('Some short description')
	->setPackageSize(PackageSize::SMALLBOX)
	...

$product2 = new Product();
$product2->setId('pTU00_test2')
	->setTitle('Testing product title 2')
	->setShortdesc('Short description')
	->setPackageSize(PackageSize::BIGBOX)
	...

$productSynchronizer->add($product1)
					->add($product2)
					...
					->post();
```

**Activation**

- Product __must__ be activated to be visible for all visitors of market place. 
- Default stage of product after uploading to market place is `draft`.
- Partner can activate product ( and all of it's associated variants ) with invoking `#activate($productId)` method. Invoking this method will switch product stage to `live`, this action is irreversible. Product in `live` stage can't be switched back to `draft`.
- Partner can invoke this method only if has allowed this action by onboarding team. Invoking this method wihtout permission to do so will not change product stage.

```
...
$productService = new Products($mpapiClient);

$productService->activate('pTU00_test');
```
